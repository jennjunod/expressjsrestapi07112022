## Helpful concepts/best practices:

- Create a dedicated “code” folder for all of your projects
- In the naming convention in the terminal, when calling a folder, double quote and single quote CAN be used interchangeably
- “code .” still not working in the  terminal, use shift+cmd+p in vs code to activate “Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH”
